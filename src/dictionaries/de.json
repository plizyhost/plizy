        "question": "What do you get with an IPTV subscription?",
        "answer": "An IPTV subscription means you never have to deal with your cable provider ever again. One of the first things you’ll notice about an IPTV subscription is you get so many choices.\n\nOur subscription services has more than 35,000 channels. The next thing you’ll notice is how quickly those channels load and how secure the connection is.\n\nIf you tried something like CCloud, you’ll know it could take minutes to connect to an online channel.\n\nThat’s not the case with IPTV as you’ll connect as quickly as you would to channels with a cable company. Even better, most of those channels are of excellent quality, if not total in full HD.\n\nTV streaming services load super-quick. Most people who use IPTV have never seen a blank screen or buffering icon.\n\nAs far as channel variety goes, you’ll have all the big names and pay-per-view (PPV) channels with a high-quality stream.\n\nWhat you get with IPTV is everything that you’d get with standard TV and a little bit more to sweeten the deal.\n\nWith an IPTV subscription, you get access to many movies and TV shows with TV series and sports channels being 2 of the most popular reasons why people pay a monthly subscription to an IPTV service as you can access all of these features in full HD at an affordable price."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's an IPTV subscription ?",
        "answer": "More people than ever before are getting rid of cable to save money and consolidate their services. Who wants to pay hundreds of dollars a month for thousands of channels you don’t watch?\n\nThis situation led to the birth of IPTV. The Android TV Box was the start of the IPTV subscription revolution and now these boxes are found in most homes across the US.\n\nHowever, that humble little box isn’t enough by itself. You can’t get standard channels through an Android Box. Not without paying more and essentially ending up with a different, lower-quality, version of cable TV.\n\nIPTV (stands for internet protocol television) is the solution the world needed. IPTV providers work hard to deliver the content people want.\n\nBig cable companies aren’t happy about it, but they’re more upset they can’t keep ripping you off."
